const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is the main operational objective?', answer: 'To improve ESP reliability and decision quality using field-measurable signals, documented assumptions, and staged verification.' },
  { question: 'How often should teams review assumptions?', answer: 'Whenever rates, choke, separator performance, or power conditions change materially—at minimum on a quarterly cadence for stable wells.' },
  { question: 'What data is most valuable?', answer: 'Time-aligned intake pressure, motor electrical parameters, vibration where available, and production trends.' },
  { question: 'Can Prestil Energy support implementation?', answer: 'Yes. Prestil Energy helps translate well conditions into equipment selection, operating envelopes, and monitoring priorities.' },
  { question: 'What is a common pitfall?', answer: 'Treating a single snapshot as proof without trending across operating states.' },
  { question: 'How does this relate to run life?', answer: 'Better intake and mechanical margins reduce cycling damage and unplanned interventions.' },
  { question: 'Should VSD settings be included?', answer: 'Yes. Ramp profiles and harmonic filtering influence motor heating and mechanical excitation.' },
  { question: 'What about high-GOR wells?', answer: 'Gas-handling strategy must be coordinated with pump hydraulics; see Prestil Energy gas separation guidance.' },
  { question: 'Is training required?', answer: 'Short operator briefings improve alarm response consistency and reduce false escalations.' },
  { question: 'What is the first practical step?', answer: 'Establish baselines after stable operation, then define thresholds tied to production consequence.' },

          <h2>Vendor access risk</h2>
          <p>Remote vendor sessions can become persistent attack paths if credentials and scopes are unmanaged.</p>
          <h2>Baseline controls</h2>
          <p>Require MFA, time-bound access, session logging, and least-privilege role assignments.</p>
          <h2>Governance cadence</h2>
          <p>Review active vendor accounts monthly and revoke stale permissions immediately.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Structured field practice improves margin, reduces reactive troubleshooting, and supports consistent ESP performance across the well life cycle.</p>
