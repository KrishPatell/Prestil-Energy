  { question: 'What is the main operational objective?', answer: 'To improve ESP reliability and decision quality using field-measurable signals, documented assumptions, and staged verification.' },
  { question: 'How often should teams review assumptions?', answer: 'Whenever rates, choke, separator performance, or power conditions change materially—at minimum on a quarterly cadence for stable wells.' },
  { question: 'What data is most valuable?', answer: 'Time-aligned intake pressure, motor electrical parameters, vibration where available, and production trends.' },
  { question: 'Can Prestil Energy support implementation?', answer: 'Yes. Prestil Energy helps translate well conditions into equipment selection, operating envelopes, and monitoring priorities.' },
  { question: 'What is a common pitfall?', answer: 'Treating a single snapshot as proof without trending across operating states.' },
  { question: 'How does this relate to run life?', answer: 'Better intake and mechanical margins reduce cycling damage and unplanned interventions.' },
  { question: 'Should VSD settings be included?', answer: 'Yes. Ramp profiles and harmonic filtering influence motor heating and mechanical excitation.' },
  { question: 'What about high-GOR wells?', answer: 'Gas-handling strategy must be coordinated with pump hydraulics; see Prestil Energy gas separation guidance.' },
  { question: 'Is training required?', answer: 'Short operator briefings improve alarm response consistency and reduce false escalations.' },
  { question: 'What is the first practical step?', answer: 'Establish baselines after stable operation, then define thresholds tied to production consequence.' },

          <h2>Why diffuser wear is invisible until it is not</h2>
          <p>Head loss often appears as a slow curve shift rather than an abrupt trip. Mapping which stages lose head first tells maintenance whether wear is intake-led, mid-string, or discharge-led.</p>
          <h2>Trend method</h2>
          <p>Normalize head against rate and speed, then overlay shutdown-to-restart snapshots. Persistent offset after a restart points to geometry change, not a temporary gas or viscosity event.</p>
          <h2>Field actions</h2>
          <p>When wear maps concentrate on first stages, review sand control and intake screens. When they concentrate downstream, review thrust, alignment, and operating point relative to BEP.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Structured field practice improves margin, reduces reactive troubleshooting, and supports consistent ESP performance across the well life cycle.</p>
